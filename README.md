# CIS1054-Coursework

Name: Amnaj Indian Cuisine

Description: This website was created to serve a fictional Indian restaurant in Blue Grotto, Qrendi, 
in order for it to have an online presence in hopes of reaching more customers and therefore directing more business towards it.

Main Features: 
The user can find a general description of the restaurant's history on the Home page [Index].
The people who work at the restuarant also have a short description about themselves in the 'About' Page.
The user can view the different meals the restaurant serves in the 'Menu' page, by clicking on one of the "Meal Types" [for example 'Starter' or 'Main Course'] 
and then clicking on the meal they wish to view more details about. 
Once a user clicks on one of the meals, they are redirected to a page containing more details on the selected item, including its name, a general description, 
ingredients, the price and any allergy/religious restrictions concerns.
The user can also contact the restuarant by email through the 'Contact' Page, where one can write their Name, Email, Subject of the Email and a Message. This 
can be used to send a complaint/compliment, inquire about a booking, or anything the user may wish to contact the restaurant about.
There is also an Account function, where the user can sign up on the website, which allows him/her to add any meals to their favourites list and mail said list
to an email of their choosing. The user is also allowed to change any of their own account details at any time.

Admin status is also available on the website, where a logged in admin can access an 'Admin Page', which allows them to add dishes to the Menu, view, edit or delete
any items on said menu, add, view, edit or delete any 'Dish Type' or 'Team Members', and Edit the Restaurant Details, which includes the Home page history and the 
Restaurant Details in the Footer.
